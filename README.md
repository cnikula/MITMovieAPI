# MoveAPI

This is a code sample using ASP.Net Web API (.Net 8) on how to build a simple API with Swagger documentation and using JWT authenticatio!

## See Meghna Articles
JWT Authentication using ASP.NET Core Web API. We wonâ€™t be using any additional Data Base Connection and will define the user credentials in the code for simplicity.
JWT Authentication is a popular method to provide authentication while exchanging data between two parties. It is a token-based stateless authentication mechanism. 
JWT is mostly used for API authentication and server-to-server authentication.

Implemented the authentication mechanism to secure your API endpoints, but confused about how can we use the token provided by your authentication scheme in order 
to access other APIs that are actually authorized ? This confusion can be common for the newbies in ASP.NET programming. Especially, while implementing the 
Authentication and Authorization mechanism. It is actually quite simple to add the Authorize option in your swagger in order to provide the token and authorize 
the endpoints in your application.
